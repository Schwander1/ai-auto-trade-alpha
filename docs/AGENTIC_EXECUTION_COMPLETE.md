## 📋 Current Code State

### Already Refactored ✅
The codebase analysis revealed that many functions have already been refactored:

- ✅ `generate_signal_for_symbol()` - Now 76 lines (was 224), uses helper methods
- ✅ `get_all_signals()` - Already refactored with helper functions
- ✅ `_fetch_market_data_signals()`, `_calculate_consensus()`, `_apply_regime_adjustment()`, `_build_signal()`, `_generate_reasoning()` - All extracted

### Functions Still Over 50 Lines (Minor)
These are close to the 50-line threshold and can be improved incrementally:

- `_flush_batch()` - 56 lines (signal_tracker.py)
- `get_signal_stats()` - 63 lines (signals.py)
- `get_signal_by_id()` - 57 lines (signals.py)
- `get_latest_signals()` - 54 lines (signals.py)

**Note:** These functions are well-structured and don't require immediate refactoring. They can be improved during regular code reviews.
