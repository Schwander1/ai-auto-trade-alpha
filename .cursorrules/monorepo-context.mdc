# Monorepo Context Detection Rules

## Project Detection

When files are modified, automatically detect project context:

- Files in `argo/**` → Argo Capital project
- Files in `alpine-backend/**` → Alpine Analytics (backend)
- Files in `alpine-frontend/**` → Alpine Analytics (frontend)
- Files in `packages/**` → Shared code (affects all projects)

## Project Coupling

- `alpine-backend/` and `alpine-frontend/` are coupled
- Always deploy both together as "alpine-analytics"
- Test both when either changes

## Cross-Project Changes

If changes detected in BOTH `argo/` AND `alpine-*/`:
- STOP and ask user to clarify which project to deploy
- Never deploy both in single operation

## Shared Package Changes

When `packages/` changes:
- Test ALL projects: `argo`, `alpine-backend`, `alpine-frontend`
- All must pass before deployment
- Warn if package version not updated
