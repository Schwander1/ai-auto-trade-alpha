# Monorepo Context Detection Rules

**This file references the comprehensive monorepo rules in the `Rules/` folder.**

## Primary Reference

**See:** `Rules/10_MONOREPO.md` for complete monorepo structure, project coupling, and shared package management rules.

## Quick Reference

### Project Detection
When files are modified, automatically detect project context. See `Rules/10_MONOREPO.md` for details.

### Project Coupling
- `alpine-backend/` and `alpine-frontend/` are coupled
- Always deploy both together as "alpine-analytics"
- Test both when either changes

### Cross-Project Changes
If changes detected in BOTH `argo/` AND `alpine-*/`:
- STOP and ask user to clarify which project to deploy
- Never deploy both in single operation

### Related Rules

- **Project-Specific:** `Rules/11_FRONTEND.md`, `Rules/12_BACKEND.md`
