ps aux | grep signal_generation
```

### Monitor Signals
```bash
python3 scripts/monitor_signals.py
```

### Check Paper Trading Setup
```bash
python3 scripts/setup_paper_trading.py
```

### View Service Logs
```bash

```

### Check Recent Signals
```bash
sqlite3 argo/data/signals.db "SELECT symbol, action, confidence, timestamp FROM signals ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### You Don't Need Expensive APIs!
- **GLM is FREE** (20M tokens/month)
- **Existing data sources are mostly FREE** (Massive, Alpha Vantage, yfinance)
- **Chinese models add 10% weight** - nice to have, not critical
- **Signal quality comes from consensus** - not from one expensive API

### Focus On:
1. ✅ Signal quality (80%+ confidence)
2. ✅ Risk management (prop firm compliance)
3. ✅ Profitability (prove the system works)
4. ✅ Then scale (reinvest profits)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Service Not Running
```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep signal_generation

# Start service
cd /Users/dylanneuenschwander/argo-alpine-workspace
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/argo
python3 start_service.py
```

### No Signals Generating
- Check confidence threshold (should be 80%+)
- Verify data sources are working
- Check API keys are valid
- Review logs for errors

### High Costs
- Verify GLM is being used (FREE)
- Check cache is working (should see fewer API calls)
- Ensure DeepSeek is fallback only
